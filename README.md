# Memory Game Project

This is the second project of the Front End Developer Nanodegree by Udacity. The goal is to develop a working
version of a classic memory game. The starter code provided the main look of the card deck (HTML & CSS). Inside
the app.js file you had a shuffle function provided but everything else had to be coded by yourself.
